# deckofcards
I made a really dumb game of War.
You get 5 cards and Bad_AI gets 5 cards.
You each pick 1 card from your respective hands and compare their ranks (ties go to Bad_AI).
Try to win :P


To make this work:
Clone this repo in your <USERNAME>/go/src/github directory
Go to the <USERNAME>/go/src/github/deckofcards directory
run `go run main.go`
Have lots of giggles
